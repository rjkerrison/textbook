          <p>There are three main languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
          <p>We'll take a look at each of them.</p>

            <p>
              We'll talk about the three languages, how they relate, and see
              what they look like.

            <p>
              JavaScript is the big beast, so we'll spend time coding along as
              Robin builds a small grid-based game.

            <p>In groups of around three, you'll start building a game.</p>
            <p>
              You can start from any of the examples we've seen, or if you're
              feeling confident, start from zero.
