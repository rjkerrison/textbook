# Invocation

When we talk about an **invocation** of a function, we are referring to the act of using that function and running through its instructions.

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello world')
}
sayHello()
```

It is the fourth line above where we **invoke** the function.

This is also often referred to as _**calling** the function_, _making a **call** to the function_, or _making a function **call**_.
You could think of calling a pizza for a takeaway as an analogy: you **call** the pizza shop and they [**return**](./return.md) a pizza.

**Call** and **invoke** are equivalent verbs in programming.
