# JavaScript

JavaScript is a language with an odd history, and is the third language of the web.

Modern browsers are very closely aligned on their interpretation of JavaScript.
This was not always the case.

Today, the latest version of the official specification for web scripting is known as ECMAScript, and the current version is ECMAScript 6. There are annual releases 

All of this is to say that the following terms are almost equivalent:

- **JavaScript**, the programming language itself
- **ECMAScript** is the specification for what JavaScript should do
- **ECMAScript 6** or **ES6** is the latest version of the standards
- **ECMAScript 2015**, **2016**, â€¦ **2021** are annual updates to the **ES6** specification
- **ECMAScript 7** is, at the time of writing**, a future major update to the specification

You may learn that some features of JavaScript were introduced in ES6, for example, or are only available from ES2017 onwards.
If in doubt, [official documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org) exists where you can find compatibility tables for features in major browsers.
The compatibility tables tell you the earliest version of a browser to support a given feature. There's also a popular alternative to the official guide at [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com).
