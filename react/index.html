            <h3>Basics</h3>
            <p>
              React is a frontend framework. It is very popular in industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              To start learning React, you should follow the official React
              tutorials. The main concepts you'll need to understand to start
              building in React are Components and Hooks.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>
              Components are instructions to React for rendering something on
              the page. They are generally written as functions which return a
              block of JSX. They can be reusable, in which case we would allow
              them to be configured with <code>props</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <dfn><abbr title="JavaScript Extended Syntax">JSX</abbr></dfn>
              looks like HTML code with additional JavaScript expressions
              wrapped in curly braces. <code>props</code> are provided with a
              syntax like HTML attributes.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Hooks</h3>
            <p>
              Hooks are additional functionality that can allow components to
              interact with React's state management features. The first hooks
              you'll learn about are
              <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="additional-features">
        <h2><a href="#additional-features">Additional Features</a></h2>
        <div class="section-inner">
          <div>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
              To avoid prop-drilling, the common issue in React where props are
              passed down a series of descendant components before they are
              finally used programmatically, the React team created the Context
              module.
            </p>
            <p>
              To use it, you need to use the <code>useContext</code> hook. To
              build a Context provider, you create a specific component.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>DOM Reference</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes, you need direct access to the DOM element. This is
              where we would use the <code>useRef</code> hook.
            </p>
            <p>
              We pass a <code>ref</code> prop to an HTML element in our JSX;
              React will then populate the <code>ref.current</code> property
              with a reference to the rendered DOM element, and from there we
              have full access to its properties.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>React Router</h3>
            <p>
              Advancing from a basic single-page application, React Router
              allows for simulating multiple pages in the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              React Router is an open source package which is installed as an
              additional dependency. It it not maintained by the React
              maintainers, but by a third party.

            <h3>Alternative build system</h3>
            <p>
              You will encounter <em>create-react-app</em> when starting to
              learn React. As standard, <em>create-react-app</em> uses webpack
              to bundle all your React code before serving it to the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vite is an alternative to using webpack. You can scaffold a new
              React app with Vite.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <p>
              The main advantage of switching to Vite is that it is much faster
              for development as it
              <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html"
                >serves your code as modules</a
              >.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Advanced</h3>
            <p>
              You can go even further by

              >
              too.

              It ought to be fast; I haven't tried it. Check out the
              <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html">

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>with Next.js</h3>
            <p>
              That's kind of the whole point of Next.js: server-side rendering
              your React code. Next has its own routing capabilities.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>with Remix</h3>
            <p>
              That's the whole point of Remix: server-side rendering. Remix is
              built by the team behind React Router, so if you like React
              Router, you may like Remix.

          <div>
            <h3>Svelte</h3>
            <p>
              It's very cool; I've seen it used once but it really seemed great.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>SolidJS</h3>
            <p>
              People apparently prefer this even to Svelte. I don't like the
              name. It is built following in React's footsteps and should be
              easy to learn after learning React.
